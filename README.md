## General info

A friend of mine recently became a qualified electrician and asked if I could make him a website, and that I could add it to my portfolio. This is the result. Having taken a template, I have edited and added a lot to this page, and learned many new things in doing so - FavIcons, CSS animation, Unsplash for background images, Adding a Google Map and more. It is a work in progress, and screenshots will be added on completion.

## Screenshots
